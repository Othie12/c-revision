# C programming main components
This contains an overview of a few things one needs to know in structured C programming.
It is a little comprehensive and simple.

## cloning the repository.
You can clone the repo by simply copying and pasting this code in your terminal.

### First create the directory.
```
mkdir c-revision
cd c-revision
```
### Then clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Othie12/c-revision.git
```

Linux users `like me` may need to prepend this statement with a sudo like this.
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/Othie12/c-revision.git
```

***Remember to do this inside the folder you want to have the code in.***

## Running the code
It may depend on the compiler you are using but for Ubuntu users, gcc compiler comes pre-installed so you just need to run like this.
```
gcc <filename>.c
./a.out
```
***Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to run***

You can also run these things using a code editor like devc++, codeblocks etc
